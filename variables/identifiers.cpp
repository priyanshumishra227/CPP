/*
    all variables must be unique names these unique names are called identifiers . 

    identifiers can be short like l , b , r or can be descriptive like length , breadth or radius 

    it is recommended to use descriptive names to make the code more understandable and manageable

    General Rules 

        Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
        Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
        Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) . Acutally the full c++ language is case-sensitive.
        Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
        Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
